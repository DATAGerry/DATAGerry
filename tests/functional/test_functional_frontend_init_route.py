Functional tests for the two routes served at the /rest root

Exercises both endpoints of ``routes/connection.py`` end-to-end through the REST test client.

``GET /frontend_init`` returns the raw contents of app-config.json (read fresh from
SystemConfigReader.RUNNING_CONFIG_LOCATION per request) and degrades to an empty dict when the file is
missing or malformed. The config directory is pointed at a temporary path so the on-disk fixture is
fully controlled by each test.

``GET /`` is the reachability probe, added here on 2026-08-27: the whole route was untested, including
the 500 it answers when the database status probe fails. Its database manager is resolved per request
from the app (it used to be captured at module import, which is why these tests had to import the
module lazily and patch module state - both worked around on 2026-09-07), so a broken manager is
injected by patching the app the test client is bound to. Both routes are unauthenticated by design,
which is what makes them reachable in these tests without a token.
