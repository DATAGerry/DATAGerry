Unit tests for RenderResult

The serialization is a frontend contract: the Angular `RenderResult` model mirrors the attribute
names one to one, and declares `current_render_time` as the bson extended-JSON `{$date: ...}` shape,
which the `json_codec.default` hook produces from the raw datetime left in place here.
