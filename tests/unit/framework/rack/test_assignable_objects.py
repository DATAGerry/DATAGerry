Unit tests for cmdb.framework.rack.assignable_objects

Pure, no database. One positive marker and two exclusions decide assignability: the type must declare a
location field, a RACK-marked type is never mountable, and an object already in THIS rack is out. The tests
pin that the rules are APPENDED behind the caller's own ?filter= rather than merged into it - a caller must
not be able to name the same key and widen the result - that an empty location-field list means nothing is
assignable rather than everything, and that a picker row carries the mount-row keys plus the rack hint
