Unit tests for cmdb.framework.port.interface_links

The resolution of a SOFT reference, and the detection of when it no longer resolves.

Two things carry these tests. First, that a row id is only unique WITHIN its section, so the section
has to be part of the match - looking a row up by id alone would silently return a row of another
section whenever the two happen to share a number, and the link would resolve to the wrong interface.
Second, that a link is dangling for three different reasons - the object is gone, the section is gone,
the row is gone - which all read the same to the customer and must all be reported.

Pure tests: the CmdbObject documents are handed in as plain dicts, no Mongo and no managers
