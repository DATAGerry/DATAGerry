Unit tests for cmdb.framework.port.cascade

A port is stored outside its owner's document and a connection outside both of the ports it joins, so
this cascade is the only thing that removes either when the object goes.

The rule these tests exist to pin is the ORDER: a connection is found through its endpoints and a port
does not name its connections, so the ports have to be READ before they are deleted. Getting it the
wrong way round leaves links whose endpoint no longer resolves, and nothing downstream would notice.

Pure tests: the managers are mocks, so what is asserted is that each removal is a single statement,
that it is never skipped for a reason the user cannot see, and that the two halves run in the right
sequence
