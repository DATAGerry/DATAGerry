Unit tests for cmdb.framework.ci_explorer.graph

Pure tests: no Mongo, no Flask. The seven sibling modules each own their own piece (argparsing, edges,
nodes, relations, ipam, locations, enrichment); this module owns the **assembly** - which was the only
layer of the package without a test of its own, and where every uncovered branch sat.

The managers are stubs, so what is exercised is the orchestration: which reads happen, what is skipped
and reported, and which bucket a composed neighbour lands in.

Four rules are pinned here:

  - the focal object must exist; a missing one raises rather than returning an empty graph, which used
    to make a typo'd id indistinguishable from an isolated CI - and with a 200
  - the focal object's CmdbType must resolve, because a graph with no root node is not the graph that
    was asked for; every OTHER missing piece is skipped and logged instead
  - the neighbour cap reads in a deterministic order, so the same request truncates the same way twice
  - the dg_location directions are inverted on purpose: the location parent lands in the CHILDREN
    bucket, the location children in the PARENT bucket
