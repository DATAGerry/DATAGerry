Unit tests for cmdb.models.isms_model.isms_risk_assessment

Pins the four properties of an IsmsRiskAssessment that other code depends on and that nothing else
would notice breaking:

* its date fields are real dates in the document and the ``{'$date': ...}`` wrapper on the wire - the
  storage half is what lets MongoDB sort and range-filter them, the wire half is what keeps the
  frontend working
* its key set is closed: ``from_data`` / ``to_json`` round-trip exactly ``RiskAssessmentKey``, which
  the read routes rely on because they answer with ``to_json(from_data(document))``, and which the
  Cerberus schema must therefore agree with key for key
* an unreadable date is refused rather than guessed
* the fields the CmdbPerson delete-cascade filters on are indexed

Pure tests: no Mongo, no Flask
