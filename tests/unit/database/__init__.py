Unit tests for the cmdb.database package (top-level modules)

Scope is the pure, side-effect-free logic: the BSON<->JSON codec and retry decorator in
the json_codec / retry pair, and the query-construction logic in mongo_query_builder. The pymongo I/O wrappers
in mongo_database_manager / mongo_connector are exercised by the integration and functional suites
(they need a live MongoDB), and methods with known open issues are deliberately left untested.
