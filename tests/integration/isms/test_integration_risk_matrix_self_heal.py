Integration tests for the IsmsRiskMatrix self-heal, run against the bound collections

The unit tests pin the decision with stub managers and the route tests pin the HTTP contract; what is
only observable here is that the repair survives the real database: the cheap check reads its counts
from the real scale collections, and the rebuilt grid is written back through the real manager, past
the collection's schema validator.

The defect this guards against was reported against a running installation, not found in a test: a
database whose scales were configured while the old minimum-configuration guard was in place holds an
EMPTY grid, and removing that guard repaired none of them - the matrix is written by the six impact
and likelihood write routes alone, so nothing but a scale edit ever rebuilt it.
