====================

Installation
------------
NetCMDB can be install locally or on server level. The necessary steps are only different when configuring the web servers.
Default development environment is a python3 compiler version 6 (python3.6).  Main dev system is a linux distribution
with a Linux version 4.12.13-1-ARCH kernel - gcc version 7.2.0 (GCC). This compilation is also being tested. However,
NetCMDB should run on any Linux-based distribution and also on any current Windows version, as long as the current
Python versions are available.
