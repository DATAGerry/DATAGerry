Validation schema for CmdbPortInterfaceLink

A CmdbPortInterfaceLink joins one CmdbPort to one IPAM interface MDS row (collection
``framework.portInterfaceLinks``).

This module is the single source of the document's Cerberus validation schema, consumed as
CmdbPortInterfaceLink.SCHEMA. It describes the document's SHAPE only. Three rules it deliberately does
NOT express:

  - that a port is linked to the same interface row at most once - that is the unique index on the
    identity tuple
  - that the port and the interface object exist, and that the addressed MDS row is really there -
    cross-collection rules the link validator checks on write
  - that the row keeps existing afterwards. The reference is SOFT by design: a link whose interface row
    was deleted is tolerated on read and reported, never cascaded
