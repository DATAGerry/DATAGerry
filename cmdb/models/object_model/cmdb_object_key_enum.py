Scope-specific dict-key enums for CmdbObject and its embedded structures

A CmdbObject document is a nested dict: the top-level holds identity and reference fields
plus the 'fields' list and the 'multi_data_sections' list; each entry inside those lists is
itself a small dict with its own keyset. Reading or writing these structures with bare string
literals invites typos that silently fail. Use these scope-specific enums instead, picking
the one that matches where in the structure the key lives. All four extend BaseStrEnum so
members are interchangeable with their string values for dict lookup, equality and JSON
serialization, and inherit a shared is_valid() classmethod — mirroring the pattern of
FieldKey / SectionKey / TypeSchemaKey for CmdbType schemas
