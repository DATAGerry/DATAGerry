Key and identity constants of a CmdbLocation

These live in the model layer because every layer consumes them: the predefined-data seeding in
``cmdb/database``, ``LocationsManager``, the CmdbLocation routes and their helper, the Rack hooks and
the type helper. They used to sit in ``cmdb/database/predefined_data/predefined_data_constants.py``,
which meant the interface layer imported a document-key enum *upward* from the database layer; the
model is the one place all of them can depend on downward

``LocationKey`` names the document keys, ``RootLocationDefault`` the identity and sentinel values of
the synthetic root node and ``CmdbLocationDefault`` the fallbacks for the two optional render keys.
LocationKey extends / behaves as a plain string, so members compare equal to their value for dict
construction, lookup and JSON/BSON serialization
