Helper methods for calculating the IsmsRiskMatrix

The risk matrix is the grid the whole ISMS risk evaluation reads: one cell per (IsmsImpact,
IsmsLikelihood) pair, carrying their product and the IsmsRiskClass an admin assigned to it. Four
properties of it are worth knowing before changing anything here:

**It is a singleton**, always stored at ``RISK_MATRIX_PUBLIC_ID`` (1), seeded empty at setup.
``ensure_default_risk_matrix`` recreates that default if the document is missing, so no caller has to
handle its absence.

**A cell's identity is its (impact_id, likelihood_id) pair, not its position.** The grid is ordered by
``calculation_basis``, so changing a level's weight moves cells around; keying the transfer on the
public_ids is what keeps an admin's risk-class assignments attached to the right pair across that
reordering.

**The grid is regenerated from scratch on every scale change and is always consistent with the current
scales.** ``calculate_risk_matrix`` is called by all six impact and likelihood write routes (insert,
update, delete of either). It deliberately has NO minimum-configuration guard:

  - it used to require at least one IsmsRiskClass, which is not an input to the calculation at all -
    and since no risk-class route recalculates, configuring risk classes *last* left the matrix
    permanently empty while the config wizard reported that step complete
  - it used to require a non-empty scale, which left a **stale** grid behind when one was emptied:
    cells naming a deleted level. Those cells can never match again - a re-added level gets a new
    public_id - so keeping them preserved nothing and hid the real state

With no guard, an empty scale produces an empty grid (the cross-product of nothing), which is what the
wizard's own scale-minimum checks already report as unfinished.

**A risk class is assigned per cell, and 0 means "not yet"** - see ``UNASSIGNED_RISK_CLASS_ID``. That
is what ``check_risk_classes_set_in_matrix`` reads, and why an empty grid is NOT "all cells assigned"

    The RiskMatrix is a singleton seeded once at setup; if its document is absent (e.g. it was

    so callers never have to handle a missing matrix. The default carries the singleton public_id, an
    empty cell list and no unit.

    Rebuilds the stored grid when its shape no longer matches the current scales

    **Why a read repairs anything at all.** The grid is only ever written by the six impact and
    likelihood write routes, so a database whose stored grid is wrong stays wrong forever - no read,
    no restart and no later scale configuration corrects it. That is not hypothetical: every database
    configured under the old minimum-configuration guard (scales created before the first
    IsmsRiskClass) holds an empty grid that the guard's removal did not repair, and a restored dump or
    a directly seeded database can arrive in the same state. Recomputing on read is what makes the
    grid self-correcting.

    **The check is two counts, not two scale loads.** The healthy path - every read of a correctly
    built matrix - costs one `count_documents` per scale and nothing else; the full scales are only
    read when the shape actually disagrees. A grid whose CELL COUNT matches the cross-product is
    treated as current: the pairs inside it can only drift through a scale write, and every scale
    write rebuilds the grid.
