    A CmdbPortConnection is one link between two CmdbPorts

    It is UNDIRECTED: the concept is explicit that a connection is 'port A to port B' and never
    'port A into port B', so there is no source end and no target end to leak into a UI as an arrow.
    That is expressed structurally rather than by convention - the two port ids live in one
    'endpoints' array stored SORTED ASCENDING, so the two spellings of one link are one document.

    A full physical path through a patch panel is three of these: server to front, front to rear (the
    INTERNAL pairing, created automatically) and rear to switch. The pairing IS the connection - it is
    never derived from the ports' names, which the concept forbids.

    Cable information lives here, flat, and a cable CI is optional: a connection works with cable info
    alone and with both. An INTERNAL connection carries neither, which is a per-type field rule the
    connection validator holds - a document schema can only describe one field at a time
