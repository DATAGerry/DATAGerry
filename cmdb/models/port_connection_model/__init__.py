The connection entity of the Port Connectivity feature

A CmdbPortConnection is its own document in framework.portConnections joining two CmdbPorts, kept
apart from cmdb/models/port_model/ because connectivity and inventory are separate concerns: a port
exists whether or not anything is plugged into it, and 'connected' is computed from this collection
rather than stored on the port.

The link is UNDIRECTED, and that is structural: the two port ids live in one 'endpoints' array stored
sorted ascending, which is also what lets the collection's two partial unique indexes hold the
feature's cardinality guarantee. port_connection_helpers is the single source of that canonical form
