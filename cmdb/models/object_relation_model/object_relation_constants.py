Shared constants for CmdbObjectRelations

The document keys, the role an object plays in a relation instance and the relation-tab descriptor
keys live here because all three layers need the same values: the routes read them off a request body,
the ObjectRelationsManager queries and aggregates on them, and the ObjectRelationLogsManager diffs on
them. They belong to the document, not to any one of those layers, so they are declared next to the
model instead of being repeated per layer
