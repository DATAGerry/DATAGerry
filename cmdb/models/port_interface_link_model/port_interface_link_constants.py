    A FIXED list, deliberately NOT a CmdbExtendableOption: the concept names these five and calls them
    explicitly non-customizable, unlike the port's status / type / speed lists. A customer-added sixth
    would carry no meaning for anything reading the link, so there is nothing for it to configure.

      - PHYSICAL - the interface runs directly on this port
      - BOND     - the port is one member of a bonded/aggregated interface
      - VLAN     - the interface is a VLAN sub-interface carried over this port

    several ports - so it is its own document rather than a field on either side.

    The three INTERFACE_* keys address one MDS row. INTERFACE_SECTION_ID is stored even though it is
    constant today (`dg-ipam-interface`), so the triple is self-describing: a reader does not have to
    know which section the id belongs to, and a second interface-bearing section later would not
    invalidate every stored row.

    IP and MAC are deliberately absent. The interface row remains the single source for those, which is
