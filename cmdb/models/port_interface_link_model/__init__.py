The port <-> interface link entity of the Port Connectivity feature

A CmdbPortInterfaceLink is its own document in framework.portInterfaceLinks joining one CmdbPort to one
IPAM interface MDS row, N:M. It holds no IP and no MAC: the interface row stays the single source for
those, which is the whole reason a port links to one instead of copying its values.

The reference to that row is SOFT - it addresses a non-durable MDS row id, so a link whose row has gone
is tolerated and reported rather than cascaded
