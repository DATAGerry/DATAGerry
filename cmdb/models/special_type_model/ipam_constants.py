Field-name and section-name constants for the IPAM SpecialTypes (SUPERNET, SUBNET, VLAN) and
the dg-ipam-interface section template

Each enum is scoped to a single owner (one SpecialType, or the interface template) so a
member name documents which schema the string belongs to. All enums extend BaseStrEnum so
members are interchangeable with their string values for dict lookup, equality and JSON
serialization, and inherit a shared is_valid() classmethod. Use these members instead of
bare 'dg-*' string literals when reading or writing IPAM-related schemas, CmdbObject fields
or MDS rows
