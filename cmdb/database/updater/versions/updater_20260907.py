Database update 20260907: stores the ISMS date fields as real dates instead of '$date' wrappers

An IsmsRiskAssessment carries four dates and an IsmsControlMeasureAssignment two. They reach the API
as the Mongo extended-JSON wrapper ``{'$date': <epoch millis>}`` - the shape every DataGerry response
uses for a datetime, and therefore the shape the frontend sends back - and the ISMS write routes
stored that wrapper verbatim, because their Cerberus schemas typed the fields as a plain ``dict`` and
no ISMS route applied ``json_util.object_hook`` (the object, DocAPI, media and importer routes all
do). What ended up in MongoDB was therefore a sub-document where a date belongs.

A sub-document cannot be compared, sorted, range-filtered or formatted as a date, so the ISMS
reports could only ever *project* those fields, and a ``?sort=risk_assessment_date`` on the list
route ordered documents by a nested key instead of by time. The models now normalise the fields on
every write path, which fixes new documents; this migration converts the ones already stored.

**The conversion never loses data.** Only a field currently holding an object is touched, and the
value is written back through ``$convert`` with both ``onError`` and ``onNull`` pointing at the
original field - so an object that is not a ``$date`` wrapper, or a wrapper whose payload cannot be
read as a date, is left exactly as it was rather than being nulled.

**Nothing changes on the wire.** ``cmdb.database.database_utils.default`` serialises a datetime back
into ``{'$date': <epoch millis>}``, so a converted document reaches the frontend in the same shape it
had before.

Re-run safe: each pass selects by the field's current BSON type, so a converted field no longer
matches and a completed run finds nothing to do, while a run interrupted halfway resumes with the
fields it had not reached yet. The version is bumped only after every field of both collections is
done.
