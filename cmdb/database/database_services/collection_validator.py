First-boot bootstrap for a DataGerry tenant database

CollectionValidator is invoked once per database (once per process start in local mode, once
per tenant in cloud mode) to guarantee that every required collection exists, has its expected
indexes, and is seeded with the predefined data the application relies on: the root location,
the default ISMS protection goals, the default risk matrix, the predefined ISMS extendable
options, the predefined section templates, the General report category, the fixed user groups,
and in local mode the admin/admin user plus the AES/RSA keypair. Existing collections are
never re-seeded; only their indexes are reconciled against the current model definitions. The
shared cache database (DG_CACHE_DB) is created on the same pass when it is missing
