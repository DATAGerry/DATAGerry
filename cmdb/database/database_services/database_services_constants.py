Constants for the cmdb.database.database_services package

Replaces the bare string / numeric literals previously scattered across the bootstrap and updater
service modules. Each enum / class is scoped to a single owner: the Service Portal lookup, the
database updater bookkeeping, and the first-boot predefined-data seeding.
