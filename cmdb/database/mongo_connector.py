This module provides the `MongoConnector` class, the process-wide handle on a MongoDB connection

`MongoConnector` is a **singleton**: `__new__` caches the first instance on the class and returns it
for every later construction, while `__init__` still runs on that shared instance and refreshes its
attributes (including dropping the lazily-created `MongoClient`). The `MongoClient` itself is created
on first access to the `client` property rather than in the constructor, so a forked gunicorn worker
builds its own client instead of inheriting the parent's.

Two behaviours of this module are surprising and are recorded as open items rather than changed here:

* **TLS is decided by the connection string alone.** `__init__` drops the caller's deprecated `ssl`
  option **without carrying its value over** and sets `tls` solely from whether `CONNECTION_STRING`
  uses the `mongodb+srv://` scheme. A caller asking for `ssl=True` over a plain host/port therefore
  connects without TLS, and a `mongodb://…?tls=true` connection string has its TLS overridden to off
  by the injected keyword - see discussion-backlog #139. It also mutates the caller's options dict
  in place (#140).
* **A failed connection check raises rather than reporting a failure.** `connect()` converts every
  error into `DatabaseConnectionError`, so `is_connected()` returns True or raises but never returns
  False (#141). `disconnect()` conversely swallows its failure and reports it as an ordinary
  disconnect (#143).
* **The `@retry_operation` decorators do retry since 2026-09-09.** They used to be inert, because the
  errors they caught were converted before they could escape; `cmdb.database.retry` now decides from
  the typed error's cause, so a failed `connect()` is repeated (a connection attempt has no side
  effect) within a sub-second budget.

The singleton, its lifecycle and the `__new__` / `__init__` overlap are tracked as #144-#147.
