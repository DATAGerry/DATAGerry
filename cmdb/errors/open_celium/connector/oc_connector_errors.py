    Raised when the OpenCelium master password is not available on a hosted installation

    A configuration fault, not a caller's: every connector read and write in cloud mode is
    authenticated with it, and the manager refuses to be constructed without one. Typed so a route
    can name the cause instead of answering the generic "an internal server error occurred" a bare
    ValueError produced
