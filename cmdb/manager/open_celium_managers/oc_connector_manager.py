Implementation of OpenCelium ConnectorManager

A connector is one end of an OpenCelium connection - the credentials and endpoint of a system to talk
to. DataGerry stores none of them: every method here is a single HTTP call, and what comes back is
whatever OpenCelium answered.

Two properties of a HOSTED installation shape the class:

* **the master password.** OpenCelium is shared between tenants there, and every connector read and
  write is authenticated with a master password taken from the environment
  (`OC_MASTER_PW_ENV_VAR`). A hosted process without one cannot serve connectors at all, so the
  manager refuses to be constructed - with a typed error, so a route can name the cause instead of
  answering the generic "an internal server error occurred" a bare ValueError produced.
* **the titles are tenant-prefixed.** Connectors are registered as `<database>_<title>` so tenants
  cannot see each other's; the mapping is applied and undone by the ROUTES (`map_oc_name` /
  `unmap_oc_name`), not here - this manager passes titles through as it is given them.

On-premise neither applies: `master_pw` stays None, and the routes pass whatever password the caller
provided.
