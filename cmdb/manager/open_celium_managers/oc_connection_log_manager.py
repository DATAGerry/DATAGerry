Implementation of OpenCelium ConnectionLogManager

Every method is one HTTP call to OpenCelium's execution-log API, and what comes back is **whatever
that API answered** - `parse_response` hands the parsed JSON body through unchanged. The reads are
therefore annotated `Any` rather than `dict[str, Any]`: the flowchart endpoint answers a list in
practice, and a caller that trusted the dict annotation iterated it as a list of dicts (which is how
the cloud-mode connector-name rewrite came to be written for a shape the annotation denied)
