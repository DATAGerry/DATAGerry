This module contains the implementation of the LocationsManager

Beyond plain CRUD this is the engine of the location tree, and three invariants of the
``framework.locations`` collection shape everything in here:

* the tree is rooted in a **synthetic root document** with ``public_id`` 1 and the 0 sentinels
  ``object_id`` / ``type_id`` (see RootLocationDefault). It is seeded with the database, is not
  backed by a CmdbObject and must never be deleted - ``delete_location`` refuses it, because the
  document is reachable through ``get_location_for_object(0)`` like any other node
* ``object_id`` is **unique**: a CmdbObject owns at most one node, which is why the object-driven
  reads are single-document lookups
* ``parent`` is a nullable integer in the schema, so a stored document may carry no usable parent.
  The delete path refuses to promote children onto such a node instead of writing them out of the
  tree

Every relationship walk (subtree, ancestor chain, expanded path) is resolved in a single
``$graphLookup`` - MongoDB detects cycles itself, so a malformed parent chain terminates - and the
per-level "does this node have children" hint is one grouped aggregation for the whole level rather
than a count per node. The tree-facing reads answer with canonical location documents
(``to_location_document``) ordered by name (``sort_locations_by_name``), so the frontend never
depends on insertion order
