This module contains the implementation of the ObjectsManager

The persistence layer of ``framework.objects`` - every object read, write, delete and reference lookup
in the product goes through it. Three rules govern the methods here:

**Every write is guarded by the object's CmdbType, and the guard runs first.** ``_guard_writable_type``
is the one place that checks the type exists, is active, and that the caller's ACL grants the
permission; insert, update and delete all call it, and ``delete_with_follow_up`` calls it *before* the
ISMS cascade so a refused delete cannot destroy the object's risk assessments (it used to).

**A read may skip what the caller cannot see, a write may not.** ``get_objects_by`` and
``group_objects_by_value`` drop the objects whose type ACL denies the user and return the rest, so a
list is filtered rather than refused - the counts they produce are therefore the caller's counts, not
the collection's. Every other method raises ``AccessDeniedError``.

**The ACL is only applied when a user and a permission are passed.** Several internal callers pass
neither on purpose (a cascade cleaning up after a delete, the CI Explorer's neighbour reads); a route
that omits them is a bug, and the ones that do are recorded in the discussion backlog

        Composes the summary line for a CmdbObject that has already been loaded

        Pure composition over already-loaded data: the object as a dict and its CmdbType
        instance. The 'type label + public_id' prefix is built first, then the configured
        summary fields are appended in declaration order (separator '-' before the first
        field, '|' between fields). If anything goes wrong while walking the configured
        fields the helper falls back to the default prefix line and logs at debug level -
        a partially broken type definition should not block the caller. Centralizing this
        composition lets `get_summary_line` and `get_summary_lines_lookup` share one body

        A summary field the object has no value for contributes NOTHING - neither text nor a
        separator. Interpolating it would put the literal word 'None' in front of a user (an object
        whose summary field is unset used to read '#264 - None'), and emitting the separator alone
        would leave a line trailing off as '#264 - '. Only a genuinely absent value is skipped:
        `0`, `False` and other falsy-but-present values are real data and are rendered. The
        separator therefore tracks the first field actually EMITTED, not the first one configured,
        so an unset first field does not push a stray '|' to the front of the line
