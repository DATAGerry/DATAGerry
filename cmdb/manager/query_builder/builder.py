Implementation of Builder

The shared vocabulary every query builder is assembled from: small constructors that each return one
MongoDB query operator or aggregation stage as a plain dict. They hold no state, so they are
staticmethods and can be called either on the class (`Builder.match_(...)`) or through a subclass
instance (`self.match_(...)`).

The MongoDB operator names (`'$match'`, `'$and'`, ...) are deliberately kept as bare literals here.
They are the database's own wire vocabulary, not DataGerry document keys - unlike the field and
schema keys of a stored document, which belong in their `*Key` enums (`FieldKey`, `CmdbObjectKey`,
`TypeSchemaKey`, ...) and must never be written as literals. This module is the boundary between
those two worlds: operators in, schema keys out.

Only constructors with real callers live here. Adding one back is a two-line change, so the file
stays a description of what DataGerry actually queries rather than a mirror of the MongoDB manual
