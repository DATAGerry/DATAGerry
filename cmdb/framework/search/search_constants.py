    (`addTag('text' | 'regex' | 'type' | 'category')`) and the result bar appends the DISJUNCTION
    marker, so a member removed here rejects a payload the UI still sends.

    Four of the six drive a pipeline stage. The other two do not, and both are deliberate:

      - PUBLIC_ID is accepted from API clients; the frontend expresses "search by id" as a TEXT tag
        carrying a `publicID` setting instead
      - DISJUNCTION is a marker the result bar appends when type filtering switches to OR. Nothing
        reads it: the OR itself comes from each TYPE parameter's own `disjunction` flag, which
        defaults to True. It is accepted so the UI's payload validates - see discussion-backlog for
        whether it should be implemented or dropped

    - the backend derives what it needs from SEARCH_TEXT and SETTINGS. It is named here because the
