The rules a CmdbPortConnection has to satisfy that the database can not hold

The collection's two partial unique indexes on ``endpoints`` are the feature's real guarantee: no port
appears in two CABLE connections, no port in two INTERNAL ones, and - thanks to the stored sort - no
pair appears twice. A fourth index gives one cable CI to at most one connection. None of that is
restated here; a read-then-write check would only be a racier copy of it.

What is left over is what this module holds:

  - the endpoints are exactly TWO port ids, canonically SORTED - the sort is what makes the link
    undirected, and it happens on the way in rather than being asserted afterwards
  - **no self-connection**: ``[5, 5]`` dedupes to a single key inside one document, so a unique
    multikey index sees nothing wrong with it
  - both endpoints name REAL ports
  - **cable information is rejected on an INTERNAL connection** - the per-type field rule, the same
    shape as the Rack's occupant_validator: one document holds two kinds of link, so something has to
    say which fields belong to which
  - **the inline cable fields are rejected alongside a cable CI** - a connection describes its cable
    either itself or by reference, never both, so the five values can not be duplicated between a link
    and the asset that IS the cable and then drift apart
  - a ``cable_ci_id`` names an existing CmdbObject of a CABLE SpecialType

Pure and free of Flask: every function reports its reasons and the routes decide whether to abort. The
two that need the database take managers and still only report - so the same cores can back a write
and a dry-run pre-check without either being able to accept what the other refuses
