Validation messages of a CmdbPortConnection

Every message here names a rule the DATABASE can not hold. The cardinality rules - no port in two
cable connections, one internal connection per port, no duplicate pair, one cable CI per connection -
are held by the collection's partial unique indexes instead, and surface as a duplicate-key error the
route layer turns into its own message
