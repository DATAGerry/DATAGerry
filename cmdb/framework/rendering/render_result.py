        Serializes the render result for an API response

        Returns a *copy* of the instance attributes rather than the live `__dict__`, so a caller
        cannot mutate the render result through the value it was handed. The attribute names are
        deliberately the wire contract — the Angular `RenderResult` model mirrors them one to one —
        so this must stay a plain attribute dump rather than a curated mapping

        The values are returned unconverted: `current_render_time` stays a `datetime` and is turned
        into its `{'$date': <millis>}` form further down by the `json_codec.default` JSON hook,
        which is the shape the frontend model declares
