class RenderedFieldKey(BaseStrEnum):
    """
    Enumeration of the expansion keys a renderer ADDS to a field entry

    A rendered field starts out as the field definition of a CmdbType (whose keys are covered by
    `FieldKey`) and is then enriched by `CmdbMultiRender` with the resolved data behind a reference.
    Those extra keys live only on the render output — never on the stored type or object document —
    which is why they are not part of `FieldKey` / `CmdbObjectKey`. Use these members instead of bare
    string literals when reading a rendered field so a typo becomes an AttributeError instead of a
    silently missing expansion

class RenderObjectInfoKey(BaseStrEnum):
    """
    Enumeration of the keys inside a `RenderResult.object_information` block

    `CmdbMultiRender` copies these off the stored CmdbObject (plus the resolved author / editor
    names) into the render output. They mirror `CmdbObjectKey` members but live on the RENDER
    result, not on the stored document - `OBJECT_ID` in particular is the object's `public_id`
    under a different name - so reading them through this enum keeps a consumer from reaching for
    `CmdbObjectKey` and quietly getting the wrong key

    """
    Enumeration of the keys inside a `RenderResult.type_information` block

    `CmdbMultiRender` copies these off the rendered object's CmdbType (plus the resolved author
    name) into the render output. The block is a CURATED selection, not a dump of the type: a
    CmdbType carries far more than this, and only what a client rendering an object needs is
    forwarded - which is why a flag added to `CmdbType` does not appear here on its own and has to
    be added deliberately.

    They mirror `TypeSchemaKey` members but live on the RENDER result, not on the stored document -
    `TYPE_ID`, `TYPE_NAME` and `TYPE_LABEL` in particular are the type's `public_id` / `name` /
    `label` under different names - so reading them through this enum keeps a consumer from reaching
    for `TypeSchemaKey` and quietly getting the wrong key
