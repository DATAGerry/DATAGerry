Builds the data payloads for the SUPERNET overview view

The frontend renders a KPI strip (computed against every subnet under the supernet) and a
lazily-expandable, paginated table of top-level subnets. 'Top-level' is defined via CIDR
containment among siblings: a subnet is top-level when no other subnet under the same
supernet strictly contains it. Direct CIDR-children of any visible row are fetched on demand
via a separate orchestrator when the user expands that row

This module exposes pure helpers (CIDR math, row / summary shaping, parent-child indexing)
plus two DB orchestrators: ``build_supernet_overview`` for the paginated top-level view and
``build_supernet_subnet_children`` for the direct-children fetch

    Builds the paginated supernet overview payload

    The KPI strip in 'supernet' covers every subnet under the supernet (regardless of nesting
    depth), so the totals stay stable as the user paginates, expands rows or filters by search.
    The 'subnets' block lists rows paginated with the same page / page_size semantics used by
    the subnet overview. Each returned row carries 'has_children: bool' so the frontend can
    render an expand caret without a probe request; the direct children themselves are fetched
    via ``build_supernet_subnet_children``. Each row also carries 'is_valid: bool' - true when
    the subnet's CIDR sits strictly inside the supernet's CIDR, false when the subnet's range
    no longer fits (e.g. the supernet's CIDR was edited and orphaned the subnet) or when the
    subnet / supernet CIDR is missing or unparsable

    The top-level 'invalid_count' is the total number of invalid subnets under the supernet
    regardless of pagination, search or nesting depth; the FE uses it to render a banner that
    deep-links to the dedicated invalid-only view (``build_invalid_subnets_overview``)

    When ``search`` is empty / whitespace, the 'subnets' block lists only top-level subnets -
    those whose CIDR is not strictly contained by any sibling. When ``search`` is non-empty,
    the tree shape is dropped and the block instead returns a flat list of every subnet under
    the supernet (any nesting depth) whose 'network' property contains ``search`` as a
    case-insensitive substring, still paginated. Each row keeps its 'parent_id' / 'has_children'
    so the frontend can link back to the tree when the user clears the search
