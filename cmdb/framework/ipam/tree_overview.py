Builds the data payloads for the IPAM sidebar tree

The frontend renders a locations-style sidebar tree of all SUPERNETs and their SUBNETs. The
initial payload (``build_ipam_tree``) is one call: a flat list of every SUPERNET (each entry
carrying 'has_children' so the FE can render an expand caret without a probe request) plus a
flat list of every unassigned SUBNET - one whose 'dg-supernet-ref' is empty. Expanding a
supernet fetches its full CIDR-nested subnet subtree in one call
(``build_supernet_subnet_tree``); ``build_unassigned_subnets`` re-fetches the unassigned block
alone for targeted refreshes

Tree nodes are intentionally lightweight - public_id, name, cidr and the address family under
'type' - and skip the interface-IP counting, VLAN resolution and validity annotation the
overview rows carry. Nesting reuses the overview's CIDR-containment semantics (a node's parent
is the most-specific sibling that strictly contains it); the unassigned block stays flat
because standalone subnets are an unstructured bucket (no overlap rules apply to them). Every
list - the supernet block, the unassigned block and each 'children' array - is sorted IPv4
before IPv6, then by ascending network address with prefix length as tiebreaker; nodes with a
missing or unparsable CIDR trail their family group ordered by name
