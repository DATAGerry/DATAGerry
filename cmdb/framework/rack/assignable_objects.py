Which CmdbObjects can be mounted into a Rack, and how they are shown in the picker

One positive marker and two exclusions decide it:

  1. **the type must carry a location field** - a rack member is mirrored into the location tree under
     its rack, and the object's own location field is what records that, so a type without one can not
     be a member at all
  2. **a Rack is not mountable** - Racks do not nest, so every object of a RACK-marked CmdbType is out.
     This is NOT covered by rule 1: the Rack type has a location field of its own
  3. **an object already in THIS rack is out** - it can not be added to the rack it is already in

An object held by a DIFFERENT rack is deliberately kept: it is offered with a hint naming that rack, and
mounting it moves it. So the answer does depend on which rack is being filled, and the rack id in the
route narrows the result rather than only validating the request.

Pure: the reads happen in the route, their results are passed in, so the filter construction and the row
projection are unit-testable without a database. The route appends the rules as a '$match' stage onto
the caller's own ``?filter=`` (routes_helper.append_criteria_to_filter), so a caller-supplied filter
still applies and can not widen the result past them

    Builds the criteria that keep only the CmdbObjects which may be mounted

    The type marker is always applied, including when the list is empty: an installation where no type
    declares a location field has nothing that may be mounted, so '$in': [] matching nothing is the
    right answer rather than a rule to skip. The two exclusions are omitted when they would exclude
    nothing, so a rack holding nothing does not get a '$nin' against an empty list

    name the rack the candidate is currently in, and are null for an object that is in no rack. An
