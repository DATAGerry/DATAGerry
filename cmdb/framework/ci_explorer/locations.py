dg_location grafting for the CI Explorer

When ``with_locations`` is on, the CI Explorer extends the graph with one hop of the
dg_location hierarchy *with inverted semantics*: the location-parent of the focal object
shows up in the children bucket and the location-children show up in the parent bucket.

The helpers in this module are deliberately load-only: each returns the raw CmdbObject
documents the orchestrator should later enrich + compose. That keeps the orchestrator's
batched enrichment pass single-step (one ref-id $in, one location-id $in across the full
union of objects in scope), avoiding the per-branch enrichment the route used to do

Two bug fixes against the original route (audited in Phase 2):
  - B1: item_limit consumed by the parent collector is bounded to at most 1 slot, so
    the children collector still has the remaining budget available. The original
    `remaining -= remaining` zeroed it out
  - B2: types_filter is applied at the Mongo query level on the children collector so
    item_limit caps the *post-filter* visible count, matching the relation side
