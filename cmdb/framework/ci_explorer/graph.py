Top-level orchestrator for the CI Explorer node/edge payload

Single entry point used by the ``/ci_explorer/items`` route. Loads every object in scope (root,
relation-linked, location-grafted, IPAM-grafted) in a small, fixed number of Mongo round trips, runs
the batched ref-field / dg_location enrichment once over the full union, then composes the response in
a single pass. Independent of Flask - it takes a ``CiExplorerGraphRequest`` plus a
``CiExplorerManagers`` bundle, and reports what it cannot build by raising rather than by aborting.

Three rules govern what comes out:

**The focal object must exist.** It is loaded first, whatever the flags say, and a missing one is a
``CiExplorerTargetNotFoundError`` the route turns into a 404. Returning an empty graph instead - which
is what this did until 2026-09-08 - makes a typo'd id indistinguishable from an isolated CI, and does
so with a 200.

**Nothing else is fatal, but nothing is silent either.** A neighbour whose CmdbType or enrichment is
missing is skipped, because half a graph is more useful than none - each skip is logged with the ids
involved, so a degraded graph can be recognised as one instead of being read as the truth. The focal
object's own type is the exception: without it there is no node to draw the neighbours around, so that
is a ``CiExplorerGraphBuildError``.

**The neighbour cap is deterministic.** The linked-object read is sorted by public_id before the limit
is applied, so the same request returns the same subgraph twice; an unsorted ``limit`` returns natural
order, which MongoDB does not guarantee and which changes as documents are rewritten. Truncation is
logged, since the payload has no field that could report it.

Pipeline:
  1. Load the focal CmdbObject (always - see above)
  2. Build the object-relation criteria, fetch matching object_relations, fetch the referenced
     CmdbRelation documents, then bulk-fetch the linked CmdbObjects under the sorted cap
  3. Resolve each object_relation into a DirectionalEdge (which side the linked object is on, what
     colour / name / icon to display)
  4. When ``with_locations``, walk one hop in each direction of the dg_location tree, skipping branches
     the target_type excludes, and collect the raw owning CmdbObjects. The remaining budget for the
     second branch reflects the slots the first one spent
  5. When ``with_ipam_relations``, walk one hop in each direction of the IPAM SpecialType hierarchy
     (SUPERNET <-> SUBNET <-> VLAN/Interface) and collect the raw neighbour CmdbObjects
  6. Bulk-fetch the CmdbType documents for every object in scope (single $in)
  7. Run the batched enrichment once across the whole union: collect ref-field + dg_location ids, one
     $in lookup each, then flatten every object's fields
  8. Compose nodes (one builder for root, relation-linked, location-grafted and IPAM-grafted alike) and
     edges (relation / IPAM / location shapes). IPAM and location neighbours fold into the same
     parent/child buckets as relation neighbours, with ``metadata.source`` distinguishing them
  9. Assemble the response according to ``target_type`` (CHILD / PARENT / BOTH)

**The location directions are inverted on purpose**: an object's location *parent* appears in the
children bucket and its location *children* in the parent bucket, because the graph reads
"contains" downwards while the location tree reads "is contained by" upwards. Two tests pin it
