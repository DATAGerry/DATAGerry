CI Explorer feature for DataGerry

Builds the node/edge payload for the CI Explorer graph view, blending three independent
data sources: the CmdbObjectRelation graph, the dg_location hierarchy (with inverted
parent/child semantics), and CmdbType metadata (label, color, icon, schema).

Modules:
  - argparsing: pure validators and parsers for the query-string arguments accepted by
      the /ci_explorer/items route (target_id, target_type, flags, filters, item_limit)
  - relations: object-relation Mongo criteria building, fetch, direction-aware splitting
  - enrichment: batched ref-field and dg_location flattening (one $in query per source,
      shared by root + linked-object + location-grafted nodes)
  - nodes: title resolution, type_info shaping, single node composer used everywhere
  - edges: edge composers for relation edges (with metadata) and location edges (bare)
  - locations: dg_location grafting (one hop up + one hop down), with consistent
      item_limit and types_filter accounting
  - context: the CiExplorerGraphRequest / CiExplorerManagers pair the builder takes, so the
      pipeline passes two arguments instead of thirteen
  - graph: top-level build_ci_explorer_graph orchestrator (single entry point used by
      the /ci_explorer/items route), plus the per-phase load and compose helpers it drives
