The risk-matrix report of ISMS: three views of one grid

The report answers `GET /rest/isms/reports/risk_matrix` with the IsmsRiskMatrix grid counted three
times - by every risk assessment's before-treatment calculation, by its after-treatment one, and by
whichever applies to its current state. Each reported cell carries the identity keys of
`RiskMatrixCellKey` plus `count` and `risk_assessment_ids`; the Angular `ReportRiskMatrix` model
mirrors the three matrix keys and the cell shape, so both are a frontend contract.

Four things decide the numbers, and each of them used to be able to go wrong silently:

* **the current-state rule.** An assessment contributes its after-treatment values only when its
  ``implementation_status`` is the predefined IMPLEMENTED option, and its before-treatment values
  otherwise. That option is resolved by value (`ImplementationState.IMPLEMENTED`) - if it is missing,
  NOTHING counts as implemented and the current-state matrix equals the before-treatment one, which
  is why that case is logged rather than passed over
* **an unconfigured matrix is a state, not an answer.** The IsmsRiskMatrix is a singleton the ISMS
  config wizard produces; until it exists the report says so with ``configured: false`` beside three
  empty grids, instead of returning three empty grids that look like "nothing assessed yet"
* **a drifted cell costs its own cell only.** A grid cell missing one of its keys is reported and
  skipped; it used to raise a KeyError that the route turned into a 500 for the whole report
* **the reads are bounded.** The assessments are read ONCE, projected to the four keys the report
  uses, and indexed for all three matrices in a single pass - so the report costs two queries
  whatever the number of assessments, and does not carry their impacts, dates and references along

This is a service, not a model: it takes three managers and orchestrates reads. It lived in
`cmdb/models/isms_model/` until 2026-09-09, which made importing the ISMS model package pull in three
managers - the framework layer sits above the managers, so this is where that dependency belongs
