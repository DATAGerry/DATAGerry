Implementation of the two routes served at the ``/rest`` root

``connection_routes`` is the ONE blueprint registered without a url_prefix (see ``init_rest_api``), so
these two live directly under ``/rest``:

* ``GET /rest/`` - a reachability probe reporting the title, version and database status
* ``GET /rest/frontend_init`` - the frontend's runtime config, read from ``app-config.json``

**Both routes are deliberately unauthenticated** - no ``insert_request_user``, no ``verify_api_access``,
no ``.protect``. That is required rather than an oversight: the Angular app fetches
``/rest/frontend_init`` to learn where the API lives *before* it can hold a token
(``runtime-config.service.ts``), and a reachability probe that needs a valid session cannot report that
the backend is unreachable. Neither response carries anything user-specific

Two things to know before changing this file:

* **``connected`` can only ever be ``true``.** ``dbm.status()`` delegates to
  ``MongoConnector.is_connected``, which raises on every failure instead of returning False, so an
  unreachable database leaves here as a **500**, not as ``connected: false``. That is discussion-backlog
  **#141**; this route is where it is externally visible, and fixing it at the connector changes this
  route's contract.
* **The database manager is resolved per request**, inside the view, like every other route module.
  It used to be bound at module level inside ``with current_app.app_context()``, which meant importing
  this module needed a live app, the captured manager outlived the app it came from, and a test had to
  patch module state to reach it. Do not reintroduce that.

    Degrades to an empty dict rather than failing, because the frontend falls back to its build-time
    environment when the payload is empty - a 500 here would leave it with nothing. ``Raises:`` is
    therefore absent on purpose: this route has no failure mode

    The ``except`` below is defence in depth, NOT the primary guard: ``load_frontend_config`` already
    catches a missing or malformed file itself and returns ``{}``, so nothing currently reaches here.
    It is kept so a future change to the helper's error handling cannot turn this route into a 500
