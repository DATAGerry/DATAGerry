Helper functions for the CmdbObject / CmdbType export REST routes

The file serves two unrelated export paths that happen to share a route folder. `resolve_export_format`
belongs to the OBJECT export: it validates the requested format class before it is dynamically loaded
and driven by the framework export engine. `build_types_json_export_response` belongs to the TYPE
export, which has no engine behind it - it serializes the types itself and returns the attachment

    Determines and validates the export format class name from a request's optional parameters

    A truthy `zip` flag forces the ZIP wrapper; in that case the `classname` it will pack is validated
    against `ZIPPABLE_EXPORT_FORMATS` (so the ZIP's own dynamic `load_class` of the inner format cannot
    import an arbitrary class, and zip-in-zip is rejected). Otherwise the `classname` parameter is used,
    defaulting to `DEFAULT_EXPORT_FORMAT`, and validated against `SUPPORTED_EXPORT_FORMATS`. Both paths
    guard `load_class` against arbitrary input

        optional (dict[str, Any]): The request's optional/query parameters (`params.optional`)

    Serializes CmdbTypes into a downloadable, timestamped JSON attachment response

    Shared by both type-export routes (all types / by ids) so the serialization + download headers live
    in one place. The body is indented so the export can be read and diffed, and BSON values that plain
    json cannot encode (ObjectId, datetime, ...) are converted by the shared `default` hook. An empty
    list serializes to `[]` - a valid empty export, not an error

    A type that cannot be serialized fails the whole export rather than being skipped: an unserializable
    type is a data-integrity problem, and silently dropping it would produce an export that looks
    complete but is not
