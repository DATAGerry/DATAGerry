The write guards and lookups the port <-> interface link routes share

The split mirrors the connection routes: cmdb.framework.port.interface_links holds the pure resolution
and the dangling detection, and this module turns them into HTTP refusals.

The rule worth stating once: **creating an already-dangling link is refused, an existing link going
dangling is not.** The first is a mistake visible at the moment it is made; the second happens because
an MDS row id is not durable, and deleting the link automatically would destroy the only record of what
the customer meant
