Request keys and refusal messages of the port <-> interface link REST routes

These routes are guarded by the PORT rights (see PortRight in port_route_constants): a link is an
attribute of a port rather than an entity a user manages on its own, and the design added no fifth
right family for it. Deleting a port is what removes its links, so a caller who may edit a port can
already do everything a link right would have granted
