The write guards and lookups shared by the Port REST routes

Every one of them lives here rather than inline in the routes, for one reason: the owner-object ACL
check has to run on EVERY route, and a guard that is inlined five times is a guard that will be
forgotten on the sixth. A port is stored outside its owner's document, so nothing about it inherits
the object's access control - reading or writing a port has to ask about the object explicitly
