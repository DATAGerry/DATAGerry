REST routes for SUBNET-centric IPAM views

Exposes the subnet IP-overview read-side payload that powers the per-subnet IP table view in
the frontend, an invalid-IPs-only variant of that same payload (the rows whose IP has fallen
outside the subnet's current CIDR), the per-sector drill-down, a CSV (.csv) export of the IP
table, plus the bulk 'unassign IPs' write-side route that clears the subnet reference on one or
more dg-ipam-interface rows. The IP table is paginated and supports an optional case-insensitive
substring search against the canonical IP strings; the search filter does not affect the KPI
block or the distributions

Also exposes the paginated subnet-options list backing the dg-ipam-interface subnet picker,
filterable by address family ('type' query param) so the frontend can offer only subnets
matching the family the user selected in the interface row

Two conventions apply across the routes below:

* **The `type` query parameter carries two different meanings on this blueprint.** On `GET /` it is
  an address-family token ('ipv4' / 'ipv6') restricting the picker options; on
  `GET /overview/<public_id>` it is a comma-separated list of CmdbType public_ids filtering the IP
  table by owning type. Both are read through `IpamOverviewKey.TYPE` because that is the wire name
  the frontend sends, so each route binds it to a differently-named local (`family` vs
  `type_filter`) to keep the two apart. Renaming either would break the frontend contract
* **Where a query value is validated depends on what validating it needs.** A self-contained token
  that can be checked against an enum without touching the database is rejected here at the route
  boundary (the address family); a filter whose validity depends on type or schema context is
  validated by the framework-layer builder that consumes it (`sort`, `order`, `status` and the
  type-id filter, all in `framework/ipam/subnet_overview/candidates.py`). Either way the client
  sees an HTTP 400

A third thing to know about the surface as a whole: **the CSV export takes none of the overview's
filters**. `GET /overview/<public_id>` narrows its IP table by `search`, `sort`, `status` and a
`type` id list, while `GET /overview/<public_id>/export` accepts no query parameters at all and
always writes the whole subnet. The frontend matches that rather than working around it, so the
Export button beside a filtered table exports more than the table shows - recorded as
discussion-backlog #202, where the decision is whether the export follows the view or says so.

These routes are transport glue: reading the query string / body, resolving the managers and
mapping failures onto HTTP. The payloads themselves are built by `cmdb.framework.ipam`

        drop the row; it does not delete the owner CmdbObject)
    Other interface rows on the same owner (referencing other subnets or non-target IPs of the
    same subnet) are left untouched

    **Validation** is all-or-nothing: if any requested IP is not currently assigned within the
    subnet, the route aborts 400 with the offending IPs and no write happens. Bad input shape (a
    body that is not a JSON object, missing list, empty list, non-string entry, non-canonical IP, IP
    outside the subnet, unknown mode) also aborts 400 before any database write. Aborts 404 when the
    subnet does not exist and 400 when the public_id refers to a non-subnet object, no SUBNET
    CmdbType is defined, or the subnet's network-range field is missing / unparsable

    **The write phase is NOT atomic.** Once validation passes, each affected owner is written
    separately through ``ObjectsManager.update_object`` and there is no cross-owner transaction, so a
    failure part-way leaves the already-written owners unassigned while the response carries the
    error instead of a count. The most likely trigger is object-level ACL: ``update_object`` enforces
    UPDATE permission per owner, so a user allowed to edit some owners but not others gets the
    allowed ones unassigned and a 403 for the first one they may not touch. Callers that need an
    exact picture after an error must re-read the subnet overview

    Body:
        ips (list[str]): canonical IPv4 / IPv6 strings to unassign; must be non-empty, each
            parseable, each within the subnet. Duplicates are silently collapsed while preserving
            input order
        mode (str, optional): 'reference' (clear the subnet ref, default) or 'row' (delete the
            whole row); applies to every IP in the request

    Args:
        public_id (int): public_id of the SUBNET CmdbObject to unassign rows from
        request_user (CmdbUser): CmdbUser making the request

    Raises:
        HTTPException: 400 when the body is not a JSON object, when `ips` is missing / empty /
                       holds a non-string, when an IP is not canonical, is outside the subnet or
                       is not currently assigned, when `mode` is unknown, when the public_id
                       refers to a non-subnet object, when no SUBNET CmdbType is defined or when
                       the subnet's network-range field is missing / unparsable; 403 when the
                       object ACL denies UPDATE on an owner (see the atomicity note above - the
                       owners written before it stay unassigned); 404 when the subnet does not
                       exist; 500 on an unexpected error

    Returns:
        Response: {'ips': [str, ...], 'mode': str, 'unassigned_count': int}; 'ips' echoes the
            deduplicated request order, 'mode' echoes the resolved mode and 'unassigned_count' is
            the number of dg-ipam-interface rows affected across all touched owners
