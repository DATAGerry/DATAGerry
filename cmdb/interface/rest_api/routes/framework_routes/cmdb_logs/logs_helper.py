Helper methods shared by the CmdbLog REST routes

Holds the shared list assembly (`build_object_logs_response`, which every list endpoint routes its own
query through) and the server-side user resolution behind ``?include_users=true``.

NOTE the caller's ``filter`` collection parameter is NOT merged into the query here - it is parsed by
the route decorator and then ignored, which is a known gap (discussion-backlog item), not a decision
this helper makes on purpose.

    Resolves the distinct users referenced by a page of logs into a public_id-keyed map

    Collects the distinct ``user_id`` values from the given logs and fetches their minimal user
    projection in a single query. The map is keyed by the stringified user public_id so the frontend
    can map ``users[log.user_id]`` directly. Deleted users (a ``user_id`` with no matching user) are
    simply omitted; the log's own stored ``user_name`` remains the fallback.

    Runs an object-log query and wraps the matching logs in a paginated GetMultiResponse

    Shared by every CmdbLog list endpoint: each only differs by the ``query`` it passes, so the
    iterate -> serialize -> GetMultiResponse assembly lives here once. When the request sets
    ``?include_users=true`` the ``results`` payload becomes ``{logs, users}`` - the same paginated
    envelope (total/count/pager) with the referenced users resolved server-side under ``users`` so the
    frontend no longer fetches each log's user separately. Without the flag the payload stays the plain
    list of logs (the default, preserved for API clients).

    Args:
        logs_manager (LogsManager): Manager used to iterate the logs collection
        query (dict[str, Any] | list[dict[str, Any]]): Match filter or aggregation pipeline
        params (CollectionParameters): Pagination/sort parameters from the request
        request (Request): Active request, used for the response URL and the include_users detection
        request_user (CmdbUser): User making the request (used to resolve the UsersManager)
