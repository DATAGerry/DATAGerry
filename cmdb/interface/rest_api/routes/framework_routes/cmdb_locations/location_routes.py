Implementation of all API routes for CmdbLocations

A CmdbLocation is a node in the location tree: it mirrors ONE CmdbObject's placement, holding the
object_id it belongs to, the parent node it hangs under, and the object's type metadata for rendering.
Every route is guarded by a ``base.framework.location.*`` right (see ``LocationRight``) on top of
``ApiLevel.ADMIN``

Four things govern a change here:

* **The mirror must not desync.** A placement lives in two places - the CmdbLocation node's ``parent``
  and the owning object's location field - and every write route updates both. `LocationsManager` owns
  the node, `ObjectsManager.set_location_field_for_objects` the field; a route that touches one without
  the other leaves the tree and the objects disagreeing.
* **Racks own their placed members.** Three routes call ``guard_rack_location_change`` before writing
  and ``reconcile_object_rack_membership`` after, so a drop onto a Rack's node becomes a membership and
  a drag off it ends one. A new write route needs both, not one.
* **The tree is read lazily.** ``/tree/roots`` + ``/tree/<id>/children`` walk one level at a time,
  ``/tree/path/<id>`` opens straight to a node and ``/tree/search`` returns a pruned forest; each node
  carries ``has_children`` so the frontend can offer an expand without fetching the subtree. ``/tree``
  is the older eager route that returns the whole forest and is still used by the frontend. Every level
  is name-ordered by the manager (case-insensitive, public_id as tie-break), so no route sorts.
* **The synthetic root is reachable here.** It is a CmdbLocation like any other, and it carries the
  ``object_id`` sentinel 0 - so ``DELETE /0/object`` addresses the root. ``delete_location`` refuses it
  (400); no route may work around that, because promoting the root's children onto its own ``parent``
  sentinel would empty the tree.
* **Three write routes have no frontend caller.** ``POST /``, ``PUT|PATCH /update_location`` and
  ``DELETE /<object_id>/object`` are unused by ``location.service.ts`` - the object write path mirrors
  the location itself, and the frontend deletes via ``DELETE /objects/<id>/locations``. They remain
  public API; whether to keep them is a filed decision, not an oversight.
