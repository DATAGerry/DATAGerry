Helper functions behind the CmdbObject routes

Everything the object routes do beyond request parsing lives here, grouped by the write path it
serves. The routes stay thin: they validate the request, resolve managers and delegate.

* **Create / update** - ``apply_object_insert`` and ``apply_object_update`` are the two pipelines; both
  resolve the type, enforce the licence and the per-feature write invariants, persist, then run the
  side effects. DataGerry has no partial-update semantics on this path: the complete object is always
  sent, so the payload is authoritative
* **Partial update (PATCH)** - the one route that does take a subset. ``validate_object_patch_payload``
  guards the body, the ``*_patch_multi_data_rows`` helpers apply the row operations, and
  ``build_patched_object_data`` merges the result into a full payload that is then handed to the
  SHARED ``apply_object_update`` pipeline, so a patch gets identical invariants, versioning and events
* **Delete** - ``guard_object[s]_delete`` refuses what may not be deleted (IPAM licence + invariants,
  and a Cable CI a Port connection still uses) and is shared by the single AND the bulk route so a new
  rule lands on both; ``delete_one_cascade`` runs the consequences (locations, object groups, relations,
  ports, racks, webhooks, log, cloud config-item sync)
* **Side effects** - ``handle_notify_webhooks``, ``handle_create_object_log`` and
  ``emit_object_*_events`` are **best-effort**: each catches and logs its own failures so a webhook or
  logging problem never rolls back a stored object. The trade-off is that a successful write can leave
  no audit entry, with nothing surfaced to the caller - recorded as discussion-backlog #160
* **Re-alignment** - ``realign_objects_to_type`` and ``clean_type_reports`` repair stored objects after
  their CmdbType changed

Field values are always stored as complete ``{name, value, type}`` triples;
``validate_and_fill_object_fields`` is what guarantees that, backfilling the ``type`` from the type
schema on every write path, so a caller (including PATCH) never has to supply it
