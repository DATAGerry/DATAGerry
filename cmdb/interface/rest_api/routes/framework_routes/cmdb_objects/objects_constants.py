Constants for the CmdbObject REST routes

Holds the named values shared across the object routes and their helper so the routes never
compare against bare string literals. The CmdbObject document's own keys are NOT here - they belong to
the model (``CmdbObjectKey`` in ``cmdb.models.object_model``); what lives here is what belongs to the
REST surface: query parameters, response keys and the routes' own limits

    document as-is, ``RENDER`` returns the rendered (display) representation and ``VALUES``
    returns the stored document with its ``fields`` and ``multi_data_sections`` reshaped into
    name-keyed maps.

    ``VALUES`` is a **read-only** serialisation built for external consumers: it answers "what is
    this field worth" with a dict lookup instead of a scan over the stored arrays. It deliberately
    drops each field entry's ``type`` and every MDS row's ``multi_data_id``, so a payload read this
    way can NOT be written back - see ``build_object_value_view``. Every other top-level key of the

    from an array of params) while the MDS-references route reads ONE comma-joined value
    (`objectIDs=1,2`, what `HttpParams.set` produces). Unifying them is a frontend-visible change.

    ``VIEW`` is read off the request by the SINGLE object route only. The list and reference routes
    receive the same parameter through ``parse_collection_parameters``, which puts it into
