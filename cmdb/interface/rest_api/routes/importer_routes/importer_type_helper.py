Helper functions for the CmdbType import REST routes

Holds the upload parsing shared by the create and update routes, the batch runner that turns their
per-entry outcomes into the same partial report the object import answers with
(`run_type_import_batch`), plus the two per-entry steps that orchestrate everything else. Each step
handles exactly one uploaded entry and reports its outcome as a message string instead of aborting, so
a single bad entry never kills the rest of the batch

The work an entry goes through, and where it lives:

    1. (update only) the stored Type is read - it decides whether there is anything to update at all,
       and both the guards and the side effects need that pre-update state
    2. the rules that judge the upload  -> `importer_type_rules`
    3. the repairs that fix it silently -> `importer_type_repairs`
    4. `repaired_structure_error` re-checks what the repairs completed - a global section template
       can contribute field definitions that no rule ever saw
    5. (update only) the rules that need the stored Type -> `stored_type_update_blocker`
    6. the write itself, here
    7. the persistence side effects, here (delegating to the normal Type routes' own helpers)

Both managers the steps need are resolved ONCE per request by the route and passed down, in the same
order everywhere: `types_manager` then `section_templates_manager`, preceded by `request_user` where
a route helper needs it. (`apply_type_update_side_effects` still resolves the managers it needs
through the ManagerProvider itself - it belongs to the normal Type routes and is shared as-is.)

The user ids in an upload belong to the system the type was exported from, so authorship is always
re-derived here. A create is fresh authorship by the importer (`stamp_import_authorship`); an update
records the importer as the editor (`stamp_import_edit`) and leaves the stored author, creation time
and version alone, since those describe how the type came to exist on this system - they are simply
kept out of the update payload (IMPORT_UPDATE_PRESERVED_FIELDS), which a `$set` leaves untouched

Writing the type is not the end of the work: an import owes the stored data the same follow-up the
normal type routes perform, so `apply_import_create_side_effects` /
`apply_import_update_side_effects` run afterwards (SpecialType wiring, object / MDS / location
reconciliation, dropped-section-template cleanup). They delegate to the very helpers
`types_routes` uses, so the two write paths cannot drift apart

    Updates a single existing CmdbType from one uploaded entry

    Replacing a type by import is an edit, not an authorship event: the importing user is recorded as
    the editor, while the stored author and creation time are preserved by keeping them out of the
    update payload. Everything else the upload carries replaces the stored value

    The same rules and repairs as on the create path apply - an update replaces the fields and
    sections wholesale, so the replacement has to be as sound as a new type - plus the rules that
    need the stored type (`stored_type_update_blocker`), checked once it has been read

    The type is read before it is written: `apply_import_update_side_effects` needs the pre-update
    state to work out what changed, and that read doubles as the existence check (the update does not
    upsert, so an unknown public_id would otherwise match nothing and look like a success).
