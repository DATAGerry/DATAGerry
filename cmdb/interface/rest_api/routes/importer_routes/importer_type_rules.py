The rules a CmdbType import judges an uploaded entry by

Every rule is a function that RETURNS a message instead of raising, so a single bad entry can be
reported in the partial report without touching the rest of the batch. Three groups live here:

    * the upload-only rules, gathered per verb by `validate_create_entry` / `validate_update_entry`
    * the structural rules, run together by `validate_type_structure` - one function per rule,
      registered in _STRUCTURE_RULES, all of them reported at once
    * `stored_type_update_blocker`, the rules an update can only answer against the STORED type

The repairs that quietly fix an upload instead of refusing it are the counterpart of this module and
live in `importer_type_repairs`

    Validates the field / section structure of an uploaded CmdbType

    Every rule in _STRUCTURE_RULES runs and all findings are reported together, so one upload round
    trip surfaces every structural problem:

    1. every field name in `fields` is unique - the name is a field's immutable identifier
    2. every field carries a non-blank name and a non-blank label
    3. every field declares a known `FieldType`
    4. a select / radio field offers at least one usable `{name, label}` option
    5. the location field is singular and named `dg_location` - and only a location field is
    6. every section name in `render_meta.sections` is unique
    7. every section carries a non-blank name and a non-blank label
    8. every section declares a known `SectionType`
    9. every field name a section references is actually defined in `fields`
    10. every field is assigned to exactly one section - neither orphaned nor claimed twice
    11. every section holds at least one field
    12. `render_meta.summary` and the external links only reference defined fields

    An MDS section's `hidden_fields` count as an assignment and as content. A ref-section is exempt
    from the "at least one field" rule and its own field from the assignment rule: that field is
