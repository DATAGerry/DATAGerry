    ACL right identifiers guarding the port-connection REST routes

    A connection spans TWO CmdbObjects, and these rights are what governs it - **the endpoint objects'
    own ACLs are deliberately NOT consulted** (decision Q13, 2026-09-03). The Rack precedent for a row
    that joins two things is the same: a feature right alone.

    That is a real trade-off and it is recorded rather than hidden. A caller holding the connection
    rights can cable together two objects they could not open individually, and a connection read
    tells them those two ports exist. The alternative - requiring access to both endpoints - was
    rejected because a connection is a fact about the CABLING rather than about either device, and
    because the "either endpoint" and "both endpoints" readings differ on exactly the patch panel this
    feature exists for: a panel is routinely administered by a team that owns neither of the devices
    it patches together
