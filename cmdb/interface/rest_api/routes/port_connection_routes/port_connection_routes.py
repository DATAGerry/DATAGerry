Implementation of all API routes for handling CmdbPortConnections

These routes are the only way a connection is written. Four invariants hold across them:

1. **The connection rights alone govern the surface.** A connection spans two CmdbObjects, and unlike
   the /ports routes these do NOT additionally check either endpoint object's ACL - decision Q13,
   taken 2026-09-03, following the Rack-mount precedent for a row that joins two things. The
   trade-off is recorded on `ConnectionRight` rather than hidden: a caller holding these rights can
   cable together two objects they could not open individually.
2. **The endpoints and the connection type are immutable.** An update writes cable information only;
   a re-cable is a delete plus a create. Moving an endpoint would drop the row onto a port whose
   cardinality slot was never checked for it.
3. **The identity and the audit fields are server-owned.** A payload public_id is ignored, and
   `author_id` / `creation_time` / `last_edit_time` are stamped from the request.
4. **The cardinality rules are the DATABASE's.** A port holds at most one cable and at most one
   internal connection, no pair repeats, and a cable CI belongs to one connection - all four held by
   the collection's partial unique indexes. The routes pre-check them for a readable 400 and translate
   the index's duplicate-key error into the same wording, which is what covers two concurrent
   requests, since a pre-check is a read followed by a write.

`§35`'s rule holds by construction: every route here touches exactly the connection it addresses, and
the delete cascades are scoped to the ports actually being removed - resolving or deleting one
connection never removes another.

The whole surface is gated behind the licensed IPAM feature (see init_rest_api), like /ports and
/racks: `uses_ports` cannot be turned on without that licence either
