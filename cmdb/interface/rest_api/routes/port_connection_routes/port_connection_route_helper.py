The write guards and lookups the port-connection routes share

Two layers, and the split is deliberate. ``cmdb.framework.port.connection_validator`` holds the pure
rules and reports its reasons; this module is what turns them - and the readable cardinality
pre-checks - into HTTP refusals. Nothing here is the actual guarantee: every cardinality rule is held
by one of the collection's partial unique indexes, because a read followed by a write cannot stop two
concurrent requests. The pre-checks exist so the ORDINARY case gets a message naming the port instead
of a duplicate-key error, and ``duplicate_key_abort`` covers the race with the same wording
