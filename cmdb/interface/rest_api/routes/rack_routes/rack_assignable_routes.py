Implementation of the API route listing the CmdbObjects free to be mounted into a Rack

The picker behind "add an object to this rack". Its own blueprint rather than a further route on the
mount routes: nothing here writes, and the listing is a projection of the objects collection rather than
of the mounts - the mounts only contribute an exclusion list and the rack hint.

Paginated the way every other listing in this codebase is - `?filter=`, `?limit=`, `?page=`, `?sort=`,
`?order=` parsed into CollectionParameters and answered with a GetMultiResponse - so the frontend's
existing table machinery works unchanged. The assignability rules are appended as extra pipeline
stages behind the caller's own filter, so no `?filter=` can widen the result past them

**No object ACL is applied**, which is the feature-wide rule: a rack route checks rack rights and never
object rights. Whether a picker in particular should honour the object READ ACL is discussion-backlog

    HTTP `GET`/`HEAD` route to list the CmdbObjects that can be mounted into a Rack

    Three rules decide it: the object's type must declare a location field (a member is mirrored into the
    location tree, and that field is what records it), an object of a RACK-marked type is never mountable
    (Racks do not nest), and an object already in THIS rack can not be added to it again. All are appended
    behind the caller's own `?filter=`, so a filter can narrow the candidates but never widen them past
    the rules

    An object held by a DIFFERENT rack is offered, with `assigned_rack_id` / `assigned_rack_name` naming
    that rack: mounting it moves it. `?only_unmounted=true` narrows the list to the objects in no rack

    Guarded by the Rack's view right: this is a question, not a change. No object ACL is applied - see
    discussion-backlog item #122

    Args:
        params (CollectionParameters): Filtering, sorting and pagination parameters
        rack_id (int): public_id of the Rack the objects would be mounted into
        request_user (CmdbUser): CmdbUser requesting this data

    Raises:
        HTTPException: 400 when the object is not a Rack or a read fails, 404 when the Rack does not
                       exist, 500 on an unexpected error
