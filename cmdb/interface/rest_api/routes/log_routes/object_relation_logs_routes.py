Implementation of all API routes for CmdbObjectRelationLogs

A CmdbObjectRelationLog is an append-only audit record: it is written internally by
``ObjectRelationLogsManager.build_object_relation_log`` whenever a CmdbObjectRelation is created,
edited or deleted, which is why there is no create and no update route here - only two reads and a
delete. Every route is gated by an ACL right (see ``ObjectRelationLogRight``) and requires the LOCKED
API level; the feature itself is not license-gated, matching the two relation blueprints it records

The frontend reads the paged list and a single log (``relation-log.service.ts``) and offers the delete
behind a confirmation modal, so all three routes are live FE contract
