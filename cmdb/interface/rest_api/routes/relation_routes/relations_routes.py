Implementation of all API routes for CmdbRelations

A CmdbRelation is the DEFINITION of a relationship between two CmdbTypes; its instances are the
CmdbObjectRelations served by ``object_relation_routes``. The five routes here are the definition's
CRUD surface:

- ``POST   /relations/``            create (the public_id is server-owned, see below)
- ``GET    /relations/``            paged list
- ``GET    /relations/<public_id>`` single
- ``PUT    /relations/<public_id>`` update, plus the cascade onto its instances
- ``DELETE /relations/<public_id>`` delete, refused while instances exist

Three invariants hold across them:

1. **The identity is server-owned.** The create route drops any public_id the payload carries and the
   update route pins the document's public_id to the URL, so a body can neither choose nor rewrite a
   relation's id.
2. **The allowed CmdbTypes must exist.** Create and update refuse ids no CmdbType carries (400),
   because such a side could never be filled by any object.
3. **The cascade onto the instances is NOT atomic.** An update persists the relation first and only
   then reconciles the dependent CmdbObjectRelations (delete the ones whose type is no longer
   allowed, apply the section-field diff to the rest); a delete removes the relation and only then
   pulls it out of the CiExplorerProfiles. That order means a failed cascade leaves the relation
   already written, so those failures are reported as a partial application (500 naming what was and
   was not applied) rather than as a failed update.
