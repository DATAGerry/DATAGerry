Implementation of all API routes for CmdbObjectRelations

A CmdbObjectRelation is one concrete relation instance between two CmdbObjects, typed by the
CmdbRelation it references. The routes fall into three groups:

    - CRUD over single instances (`/`, `/<public_id>`) plus the bulk delete (`/delete/many`)
    - the relation-tab routes (`/tabs/<object_id>` and `/tabs/<object_id>/instances`), which serve one
      CmdbObject's relation tabs without loading every instance: the first returns the tab descriptors
      (one per relation definition and role, with its instance count), the second one page of a single
      tab with the counterpart object resolved per row
    - nothing else - the CmdbRelation definitions themselves live in `relations_routes`

Two invariants the write routes enforce, both of them server-side only:

    - the referenced CmdbRelation must still exist, and the two endpoints must be different CmdbObjects
      (a CmdbObject is never related to itself)
    - `author_id`, `creation_time` and `last_edit_time` are owned by the server, and a value sent for
      any of them is overwritten rather than trusted. A create stamps the author and the creation time
      and clears `last_edit_time` (a relation that has never been edited has no edit time); an update
      preserves the stored creation time, records the editing user as `author_id` (the field doubles as
      "who last touched this" - a CmdbObjectRelation has no separate editor field) and stamps
      `last_edit_time`. Until 2026-09-08 the create route left `last_edit_time` to the body, so a
      client could claim - and backdate - an edit that never happened, and the `{'$date': ...}` wrapper
      it sent was stored as a sub-document MongoDB cannot sort or range-filter

Every write also writes its history through the ObjectRelationLogsManager. That is best-effort and
always happens AFTER the write, so a failed write can never leave a log claiming a change that did not
happen, and a failed log can never fail the request (see the log helpers in `relations_helper`)
