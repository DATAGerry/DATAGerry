Helper functions for the OpenCelium connector REST routes

These consolidate the cache-first access checks (cache preferred, DG Service Portal fallback) that the
cloud-mode connector handlers each performed inline. A resolved cached-user dict may be passed in to
avoid re-reading (and potentially re-seeding) the cache within a single request.

`build_connector_manager` is the same extraction the template and execution-log routes have: the
construction was written out at thirteen sites in this package, and on a hosted installation it is the
call that reads the OpenCelium master password (and refuses without one).
