Implementation of all API routes for CmdbWebhookEvents

A CmdbWebhookEvent is one delivery of a CmdbWebhook: what was sent, where, and how the receiver
answered. The three routes here read and prune that log. They carry no rights of their own - reading
an event needs ``base.framework.webhook.view`` and deleting one ``base.framework.webhook.delete``,
the rights of the webhook the event belongs to (see ``WebhookRight``)

For the cloud API they are ``ApiLevel.LOCKED``, which is a deliberate refusal rather than a level:
``__check_api_level`` denies a LOCKED route outright, so the delivery log is reachable from the
DataGerry frontend only. Note the asymmetry with the sibling blueprint: the webhook DEFINITIONS are
``ApiLevel.ADMIN``, so a cloud API client can create and edit a webhook but can not read its deliveries

Three properties of this log matter before changing anything here:

* **It is append-only and unbounded.** Every object write produces one document per matching active
  webhook. There is no retention policy and no bulk prune - the delete route removes one row - and
  deleting a CmdbWebhook deliberately leaves its events behind, so orphans accumulate. The indexes
  declared on ``CmdbWebhookEvent`` are what keep reading it from degrading as it grows.
* **Each row holds the full object documents.** ``object_before`` and ``object_after`` are complete
  serialised CmdbObjects, and this route returns them for every row even though the frontend's table
  renders four scalar columns.
* **Reading it needs no object ACL.** Those field values are readable with
  ``base.framework.webhook.view`` alone, whatever the object's own permissions say.

    Two things about this route are unlike the other list routes and are tracked as decisions rather
    than settled here:

    - the frontend's log table sends ``?filter=`` as a **list of aggregation stages**
      (``$addFields`` + ``$match``, built in ``webhook-log-viewer.component.ts``), not as a plain
      criteria dict. Those stages reach the pipeline as given, which is why the filter shape can not
      simply be locked down on this route alone
    - each row carries the complete ``object_before`` / ``object_after`` documents, while the table
      renders only four scalar columns

    keys this route is sorted and searched by
