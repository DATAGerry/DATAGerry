Helper for the CmdbWebhook routes: validating the request parameters and emitting webhook events

Two roles, both belonging to the caller/helper layer rather than to a manager:

* ``parse_webhook_params`` normalises and validates what the create/update routes receive. The
  parameters arrive as query args rather than as a validated JSON body (a decision tracked in the
  backlog), so ``CmdbWebhook.SCHEMA`` never runs and this function is the ONLY validation a webhook
  document gets. It is therefore where the required fields, the event-type list and the URL scheme
  are checked.
* ``send_webhook_event`` notifies the configured CmdbWebhooks and records a CmdbWebhookEvent per
  delivery. The orchestration spans two domains (reading the CmdbWebhooks and writing the events), so
  it cannot live inside a manager - a manager must not depend on another manager. Both managers are
  resolved here from the request user, mirroring the calculate_risk_matrix(request_user) pattern.

Delivery rules worth knowing before changing anything here:

* **Each delivery is independent.** The POST and the event insert of one webhook are guarded on their
  own, so a webhook whose target times out can neither stop the webhooks after it nor suppress its own
  log entry. Every attempt produces a CmdbWebhookEvent, including a failed one - a delivery log that
  only recorded successes could not answer the one question it exists for.
* **Delivery does not block the write.** The webhooks are read on the request thread (one query) and
  the HTTP calls are handed to a small shared pool, because ``send_webhook_event`` is called inline
  from the object create / update / delete flows in ``objects_helper``. Delivering synchronously made
  every object save wait up to the request timeout for every active webhook.
* **Any 2xx counts as delivered**, not only ``200``.

    Normalises and validates the form-encoded CmdbWebhook params in place

    The create and update routes read their parameters from the query string, so nothing has coerced
    or checked them yet and ``CmdbWebhook.SCHEMA`` is never applied. This function is the whole of the
    validation a webhook document gets:

    - ``name`` and ``url`` must be present and non-blank (the schema marks both required, but it does
      not run - and a webhook with no URL is one whose every delivery fails)
    - ``url`` must carry an allowed scheme and a host: the server itself fetches this URL
    - ``event_types`` must be a **list** of known ``WebhookEventType`` values. It arrives as a string
      literal, and ``literal_eval`` happily returns an int or a dict, either of which would be stored
      and produce a webhook that silently never matches an event
    - ``active`` is coerced to a bool
