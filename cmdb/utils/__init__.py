Project-wide, domain-unspecific Python helpers and definitions

Domain helpers (CmdbObject-document helpers, IPAM CIDR helpers, etc.) live next to their
domain. This package is the explicit home for cross-feature, language-level utilities such
as the shared BaseStrEnum, cast helpers, logging configuration, and decorator wrappers

Everything listed in `__all__` is imported from the package path (`from cmdb.utils import ...`),
not from the module inside it - with one exception: a module *inside* this package imports its
siblings by module path, since going through the package here would be a cyclic import. Two names
are deliberately left out of `__all__`: `boolify` and `noneify` are `auto_cast`'s individual casters
rather than an API of their own, and `cmdb.utils.logger` / `cmdb.utils.wraps` are process bootstrap
and decorator plumbing that callers import by module path
